  # RomCom

  [Create your own romantic novel cover.](https://orlovorlov.github.io/romcom/ "RomCom Homepage")    


### Project Team

  Travis Rollins
  Dylan Duke
  Nickolai Orlov

  The team designed a cover generator that creates personalized or randomized romantic novel covers.

### Code Functionality

To deploy the code, navigate to: 
https://orlovorlov.github.io/romcom/

To view code in GitHub navigate to:

The homepage renders a randomized cover by default:

There is also a button that sends the user to a form page, allowing the user to enter their own data
into the fields, including a link to their image of choice.

The code also adds the user inputs to the list of randomized assets, meaning the user can also reuse those asset in a randomly generated cover.

The site will then display the compiled image, returning you to the home page.

The user can save any cover, "user made" or "randomized", with the "Save Cover" button.
These will be displayed in the saved covers section, accessed by hitting the "View Saved Covers" button at the top of the page.

Our program will also delete any cover in the "saved covers section" by double-clicking any of the covers.

### Project Goals

Our goal as a group was to learn and understand how to utilize Javascript to manipulate the HTML and CSS given to us, and craft a website from that code, with a strong emphasis on learning what the code was doing. Now that the project has been completed,
it is our opinion and consensus that both members of this team are much more confident and have come out of this project with a greater degree of coding aptitude.
