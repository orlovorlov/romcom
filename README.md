There is also a button that sends you to a form, allowing you to choose what is displayed
into the fields, and you can even post a link to your image of choice.
The code also takes your inputs and adds them to the list of randomized assets, meaning you can
pull any asset given in a randomly generated cover.
The site will then display the compiled image, returning you to the home page.

Tech Goals
Our goal as a group was to learn and understand how to utilize Javascript to
Manipulate the HTML and CSS given to us, and craft a website from that code, with
a strong emphasis on learning what the code was doing. Now that the project has been completed,
It is Our opinion and consensus that both members of this team are much more confident
and have come out of this project with a greater degree of coding aptitude.

Credits
The original base code comes from https://github.com/turingschool-examples/romcom
credit to both Nickolai Orlov and Dylan Duke for the code written for this project.
Also a massive shoutout to all of our cohort mates for being ready and eager to assist.
